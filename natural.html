		<h3>UDAWATTAKELE SANCTUARY  </h3>
		<p>Despite being quite small in size and population, 
		Kandy, with its constant beeping of horns, overzealous touts and relentless heat and humidity, 
		can get a little intense at times. That's why a stroll through the Udawattakele forest reserve, 
		situated behind the Temple of the Tooth Relic, is one of the best things to do in Kandy.
      Once the king's personal garden, Udawattakele is now an urban forest and wildlife sanctuary 
	  home to several species of mammals, reptiles, and other animals. There's a hiking path within the sanctuary, 
	  which is about a 5km round trip.
