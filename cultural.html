		<h3>TEMPLE OF THE SACRED TOOTH RELIC, KANDY  </h3>
		<p>Never has a decaying tooth held so much significance to so many people,
		yet thatâ€™s exactly the reason that the impressive Temple of the Sacred Tooth and Royal Complex (Sri Dalada Maligawa) 
		is the number one attraction in Kandy. 
       This ornate golden-roofed temple houses the most important Buddhist relic 
	   in Sri Lanka - a tooth of Buddha brought to the island in the 4th century. 
     The temple was built between 1867 and 1707 specifically to honour this sacred relic,
	 and the temple has long since been a place of importance for both Sri Lankan and international visitors. 
	 In fact, most Sri Lankans believe they need to visit the temple at least once in their lives to pay homage to the toothy treasure.

		<h3>BAHIRAWAKANDA VIHARA BUDDHA STATUE </h3>
		<p>The beautiful Bahirawakanda buddha statue sits atop Bahirawa Kanda hill 
		as if overseeing the daily life of Kandyans below. 
        Built in 1972,
		the sculpted white statue is one of the tallest in Sri Lanka (at 27m in height), 
		and can be seen from just about anywhere in Kandy. 
		Bahirawakanda offers incredible panoramic views over the green and blue hues of Kandy
		and beyond and is best to visit at sunset when the city is bathed in a golden glow as the sun drops 
		behind the mountains in the distance. </p>

		<h3>Degalldoruwa Raja Maha Viharaya </h3>
		<p>The history of the temple dates back to the 14th century, 
		and a pre-colonial Lanka where several strong kingdoms ruled the land. 
		At a time when the capital of the Sinhalese kingdom was Kurunegala, 
		that era drew to a close when the the Sinhalese kings decided on setting up the new kingdom at Gampola,
		a safe stronghold on the bank of the Mahaweli river. </p>
